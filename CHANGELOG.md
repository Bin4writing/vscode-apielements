# Changelog

This changelog tracks changes starting from first public release.

## Not released

- Added `firstLine` element in extension definition so VSCode can recognise API Blueprint documents.

- Clear all related annotations when a document is closed. See [https://code.visualstudio.com/updates#_extension-authoring](VSCode updates) for more details.

- Renamed all references from `APIBlueprint` to `API Blueprint`. Same from `APIElements` to `API Elements`
